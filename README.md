# Cultivationclysm
A mod for the game Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead. Prepare to step on young masters and usurp the heavens.
## Plants?
LET ME SAY THIS VERY CLEARLY, THIS IS A XIANXIA CULTIVATION MOD. NOT PLANTS.
## What does that mean?
Well, it basically means you are taking world energy and using it to cultivate yourself. You are improving yourself through a variety of ways.
## So what does this add?
Mainly, it adds a way to cultivate (duh). Additionally it adds a variety of new mechanics and items centered around cultivating.
## I downloaded the mod and there was like, nothing in my game.
Well yes. This is a in progress mod. This page will update to reflect if it is in a playable state. As of the time of writing this, it is not in a playable state.
